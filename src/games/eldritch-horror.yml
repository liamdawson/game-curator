Evil is stirring across the globe. It's up to you and your fellow investigators---people from all walks of life---to solve the eldritch mysteries, and save the world from certain doom.

The horrors of this investigation may be too much for some. Can you retain your life---even your sanity---long enough to stop the Ancient Ones from awakening?
